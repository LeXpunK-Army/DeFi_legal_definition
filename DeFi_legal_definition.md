   (1) in accordance with rules, algorithms or protocols; and

   (2) in a manner not requiring reliance on any custodial intermediary; 

(B) is stored and executable on a  read-unpermissioned, blockchain-based virtual machine environment governed by a peer-to-peer network of nodes running a single deterministic state transition byzantine-fault-tolerant consensus protocol; and 

(C) is not owned, controlled, permissioned, or arbitrarily modifiable by  any single person or group of persons known to one another who have entered into an extrinsic agreement to act in concert with respect thereto.
